###Mini Project

####arucoDetect folder:
This is a temp folder that we may delete later

####MATLAB folder:
This folder contains all of our MATLAB files. RunPIDSimulink runs the simulink model for our system, which we used to create the PI controller for our robot. 

####mp_arduino folder:
This folder contains all of our Arduino code for the robot. These files are broken up into hpp header files that we can load into our main mp_arduino.ino file. This runs all of the main Arduino code that will take input from the Pi and convert that into movement on our robot.   

####PythonCode folder:
This folder contains all of our Python code that we run on the Pi.
